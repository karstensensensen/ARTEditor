# ARTEditor
A editor made with python and tkinter for creating and editing .art files for the [Asciir engine](https://github.com/karstensensensen/AsciiRender.git)
### DISCLAMER
##### This is not a high quality application, it is simply here as an alternative to directly editing and converting .art files.
This is my first TKinter gui application and is therefore propably not designed in the best or most efficient way possible. It is still probably faster to create textures in this applcation than directly editing an .art file, but keep in mind that this is not a very high quality application.

Still in development...
